# 🌾 **Samarth Challenge — Agro-Climate Data Analysis**  
### ✨ *By Kanishka Chouhan*

---

## 🧠 **Overview**  
This project was developed as part of the **Bharat Digital Fellowship – Project Samarth Challenge**.  
It demonstrates how **open government datasets** can be combined to derive **cross-domain insights** between **agriculture** and **climate** data.  

---

## 🎯 **Objective**  
To compare the **average annual rainfall** across two sub-divisions of Gujarat —  
**Gujarat Region** and **Saurashtra & Kutch** — over the last 10 years,  
and relate it with Gujarat’s **total crop area (2021–24)** to understand the relationship between rainfall patterns and agricultural output.

## 🧾 **Datasets Used**
| Dataset | Description | Source |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 🌦️ **Sub-divisional Monthly Rainfall (1901–2017)** | Rainfall data by region from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). | [data.gov.in – IMD](https://data.gov.in/resource/sub-divisional-monthly-rainfall-1901-2017) |
| 🌾 **State-wise Crop Area (2021–2024)** | Crop area data by state from the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare. | [data.gov.in – MoAFW](https://data.gov.in/) |

---

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**

**Languages & Tools:**  
🐍 Python • 📓 Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

**Libraries Used:**  
- `pandas` → Data cleaning and manipulation  
- `numpy` → Numerical computation  
- `matplotlib` → Data visualization  
- `seaborn` → Advanced visual styling  

**Data Sources:**  
- [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)  
- IMD (Indian Meteorological Department)  
- Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare  

---

 📈 **Analysis Summary**
- 🌧️ *Gujarat Region* received an **average rainfall of ~848 mm** during 2008–2017.  
- ☁️ *Saurashtra & Kutch* received an **average rainfall of ~604 mm** for the same period.  
- 🌾 *Gujarat’s total crop area* (2021–24) remained relatively stable — showing efficient irrigation and resource management practices.

## 💡 **Key Insights**
🔹 Demonstrates how **open government data** can reveal the link between **climate and agriculture**.  
🔹 Encourages **data-driven policymaking** for resource optimization.  
🔹 Lays the foundation for building an **intelligent Q&A system** that can answer natural language queries using *data.gov.in* datasets.

## ⚙️ **How to Run**

Follow these simple steps to reproduce the analysis:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/samarth-agroclimate-analysis.git

# 2️⃣ Navigate to the project folder
cd samarth-agroclimate-analysis

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

In Google Colab, upload the notebook and run all cells
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 🔸 Integrate live API data from data.gov.in
 for real-time analysis.
- 🔸 Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize rainfall–crop correlations dynamically.
- 🔸 Implement a Q&A chatbot using NLP models that can answer natural language questions like:
“How has rainfall in Saurashtra affected crop output in the last five years?”
- 🔸 Add predictive modeling to forecast crop yield trends based on rainfall variations.
